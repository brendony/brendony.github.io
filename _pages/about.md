I enjoy making useful things.

I'm currently working at [CSIRO's Data61][data61], working in the Privacy Enhancing Systems group. 
Previously, I worked on image processing solutions for the now-defunct 
[Canon Information Systems Research Australia (CISRA)][cisra].

I have experience in C/C<sup>++</sup>, Scala, Python, JavaScript (React) and interest in Elm and Rust.
I am fluent in Object Oriented programming and increasingly, functional programming techniques.

Lastly, I love keyboards. [Mechanical Keyboards][mk] - especially [ergonomic ones][ergo].
