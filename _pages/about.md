I enjoy making useful things, with a tendency towards software solutions.

I'm currently working with the [REA Group], working in the Customer Product & Experience group. 
Previously, I worked with [data61] as a DevOps engineer working on Privacy Preserving technologies,
and before that, on image processing solutions for the now-defunct 
[Canon Information Systems Research Australia (CISRA)][cisra].

I have experience in C/C<sup>++</sup>, Scala, Python, JavaScript (React) and interest in Elm and Rust.
I am fluent in Object Oriented programming and increasingly, functional programming techniques.
These days the normal software disciplines (CI/CD/Test driven development) have obligatory
DevOps disciplines (Kubernetes, Docker etc) thrown in.

Lastly, I love keyboards. [Mechanical Keyboards][mk] - especially [ergonomic ones][ergo].
