# Mea culpa

It's been years since I posted last - in that time, much has changed in my
[swim meet software](_posts/2020-09-17-swim-meet-software.md):
- rewrote the entire app in Dart/Flutter using Firebase/Firestore (away from
full-stack python)
- three seasons of swimming club meets run using the software
- [documentation](https://github.com/brendony/brendony.github.io/wiki/On-Deck-App-%E2%80%90-Documentation)
written in a wiki so it's easy for me to update it

# Reflecting on the journey

Writing software in a voluntary capicity for a community organisation is a
serious commitment but at the same time, the rewards (personal satisfaction, learning, etc)
can be great.

Looking back over the project, I've come to realise that there's enough accumulated *stuff*
that I'd like to put it down in writing and talk about it.

Without further ado, then, here are my Lessons Learnt from a Passion Project.
