I think it's reasonable to say that a lot of us have found ourselves with nowhere to go in 2020! 
To keep the four walls from closing in, I've taken to serial hobbying. Where possible, I try to keep
my hobbies creative, so that I have something to show for it at the end. 
[^shopping]

I was glad to ~~find~~ make time to complete a little hardware job that I'd had 
on the back-burner for a while.

This is a Quefrency keyboard [^quefrency], with wife-approved keycaps [^keys]. Assembled from a kit. 
The green `shift` keys standing in for space bars were spares I had lying around - 
(they aren't to help us SHOUT A LOT).

## Lessons learnt

1. Making things is very calming,
1. The keyboard making hobby has come a long way in 10 years,
2. Lead-free solder is fine to work with,
3. Modern AA powered soldering irons [^iron] can be a vast improvement on 1990s-era 
cheap mains-powered irons. (So fast to warm up! Maintains heat well! ...as long
as the batteries are freshly charged), and
4. For most non-geeks, the colour of the keycaps are at least as important as the 
type of keyswitch (Gateron Browns in this case).


[^shopping]: Okay, so online shopping also leaves [tangible things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/ilnuxu/seiko_alba_aefy_502_poor_mans_casio_oceanus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). But there's something about the delayed gratification of that form of entertainment that doesn't help my state of mind.

[^quefrency]: From [keebio](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-60-65-split-staggered-keyboard?variant=12204552880222). This is the 65% version with macro keys, plate kit and PCB-mount MX stabilisers. 

[^iron]: I bought [this one](https://au.rs-online.com/web/p/soldering-irons/0537218/), but not from that link.
